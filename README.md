#Hey
I'm Gen. I have some catching up to do when it comes to looking into the code of my favorite video games, but I've decided to tackle things head-on.
The two games I primarily work with are Mario Superstar Baseball for the Nintendo Gamecube and Dragon Warrior Monsters 2 for the Game Boy Color. And yes, I know that that's a Dragon Quest game, but I deliberately use the localized title to make things easier to find.

Don't expect me to make anything cool, I'm just here to use tools...
